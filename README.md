# MyReads Project

This is a web application for everyone who loves books. It will help you keep track of the books you're reading, have read or want to read in an easy and fun way :)

It was developed as part of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**.

## Installation

You can install this app in 5 easy steps:
1. Download the files
2. Navigate to the folder where they are
3. Run `npm install` to install its dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to launch the server
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## How to use

The default screen shows your books divided into three shelves: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read** and **Read**. You may use the green button in each book to move it to a different shelf. To add more books, click the + button, search by title or author and, when you find the book you're looking for, just assign it to the appropriate shelf. The default screen will update automatically.

## Contribute

As stated above, this project is part of a Udacity Nanodegree, and therefore should be my own work. For that reason, I won't accept any pull requests.
